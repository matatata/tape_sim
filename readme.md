# TapeSim DAW
Tape Sim intends to simulate a simple tape machine experience by recording and playing audio with a simple UI.

The program records as many mono audio wav files as there are inputs in your default audio device and allows you to rewind, fast-forward and re-record over a section of time.

Playback is currerntly mixed down to stereo. 

Current UI available for this program is for MacOS made with SwiftUI.
