# TapeSim DAW
Tape Sim intends to simulate a simple tape machine experience by recording and playing audio with a simple UI.

The program records as many tracks as there are inputs in your default audio device and allows you to rewind, fast-forward and re-record over a section of time.

Playback is currently mixed down to stereo. 

Recordings are a made into mono wav files at 48khz 24bit quality

Current UI available for this program is for MacOS(Intel x86_64) made with SwiftUI.
