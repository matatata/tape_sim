# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 12/30/2024

This Privacy Policy describes how Tape Sim ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects any personal information when you use our application.

## 1. Information We Do Not Collect
Tape Sim is designed to function as a local audio recording and playback application. We do not collect, process, or transmit any personal or audio data to external servers or third parties. All recordings and data remain on your local device.

## 2. Local Storage of Data
All recordings created with Tape Sim are saved locally on your device at the following directory:
`/Users/<username>/Music/tape_sim`

The recordings are stored as WAV files named according to the track number (e.g., `track1.wav`, `track2.wav`). Tape Sim does not access, transmit, or share these files with any external parties.

## 3. Permissions
Tape Sim requires access to your default audio device for recording and playback purposes. No other system permissions are required.

## 4. Usage Analytics
Tape Sim does not include any analytics tools, telemetry, or tracking mechanisms. We respect your privacy and do not monitor or track your usage of the application.

## 5. Third-Party Libraries
Tape Sim utilizes PortAudio for audio input and output functionality. PortAudio is an open-source library and operates entirely within the application. No data is shared with or transmitted to the PortAudio project or its maintainers.

## 6. Security Measures
While we do not transmit or collect any personal data, we recommend that users protect their device and files from unauthorized access. Tape Sim does not include encryption or advanced security measures for your locally saved recordings.

## 7. Updates to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our application or legal requirements. Updates will be published alongside new versions of the application, and the "Effective Date" will be revised accordingly.
